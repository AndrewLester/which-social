## About
Which Social is a Chrome extension that remembers which social media platform you last logged in with for a given site. Automated and configurable, it does most of the work for you. You can also disable the extension on sites of issue. Inspired by [WhichLogin](https://whichlogin.com/about-us/) which is now gone.
